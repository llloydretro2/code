①Hi,everybody.Aniyah,thank you for that beautiful introduction.I could not be prouder of everything you have done in your time with the Obama Foundation.And,of course,I couldn't be prouder of all of you in the graduating Class of 2020,as well as the teachers and the coaches and most of all, parents and family who guided you along the way.Now,graduating is a big achievement under any circumstances.Some of you have had to overcome serious obstacles along the way,whether it was an illness, or a parent losing a job,or living in a neighbourhood where people too often count you out.Along with the usual challenges of growing up,all of you had to deal with the added pressures of social media,reports of school shootings, and the specter of climate change.
②And then,just as you're about to celebrate having made it through,just as you have been looking forward to proms and senior nights,graduation ceremonies,and,let's face it,a whole bunch of parties,the world is turned upside down by a global pandemic.And as much as I'm sure you love your parents,I will bet that being stuck at home with them and playing board games or watching Tiger King on TV is not exactly how you envisioned the last few months of your senior year.Now,I will be honest with you,the disappointments of missing a live graduation,those will pass pretty quick.I don't remember much of my own high school graduation.I know that not having to sit there and listen to a commencement speaker isn't all that bad.Mine usually go on way too long.Also,not that many people look great in those caps,especially if you have big ears like me.And you will have plenty of time to catch up with your friends once the immediate public health crisis is over.
③But what remains true is that your graduation marks your passage into adulthood,the time when you begin to take charge of your own life.It's when you get to decide what's important to you,the kind of career you want to pursue,who you want to build a family with,the values you want to live by.And given the current state of the world,that may be kind of scary.If you'd planned on going away for college,getting dropped off at campus in the fall,that's no longer a given.If you were planning to work while going to school,finding that first job is going to be tougher.Even families that are relatively well off are dealing with massive uncertainty.Those who were struggling before,they're hanging on by a thread.All of which means that you're going to have to grow up faster than some generations.
④This pandemic has shaken up the status quo and laid bare a lot of our country's deep -seated problems,from massive economic inequality,to ongoing racial disparities,to a lack of basic health care for people who need it.It has woken a lot of young people up to the fact that the old ways of doing things just don't work;that it doesn't matter how much money you make if everyone around you is hungry and sick;and that our society and our democracy only work when we think not just about ourselves,but about each other.It has also pulled the curtain back on another hard truth,something that we all have to eventually accept once our childhood comes to an end.And all those adults that you used to think were in charge and knew what they were doing?Turns out,they don't have all the answers.A lot of them aren't even asking the right questions.So,if the world's going to get better,it's going to be up to you.That realization may be kind of intimidating,but I hope it's also inspiring.
⑤With all the challenges this country faces right now,nobody can tell you,"no,you're too young to understand,"or "this is how it has always been done."Because with so much uncertainty,with everything suddenly up for grabs,this is your generation's world to shape.Since I'm one of the old guys,I won't tell you what to do with this power,that rests in your hands,but I will leave you with three quick pieces of advice.First,don't be afraid.America has gone through tough times before-slavery,civil war,famine,disease,the Great Depression,and 9/11.And each time we came out stronger,usually because a new generation,young people like you,learned from past mistakes and figured out how to make things better.Second,do what you think is right.Doing what feels good,what's convenient,what's easy,that's how little kids think.Unfortunately,a lot of so-called grown-ups,including some with fancy titles and important jobs,still think that way,which is why things are so screwed up.
⑥I hope that instead,you decide to ground yourself in values that last,like honesty,hard work,responsibility,fairness,generosity,respect for others.You won't get it right every time,you will make mistakes like we all do,but if you listen to the truth that's inside yourself,even when it's hard,even when it's inconvenient,people will notice.They'll gravitate towards you.And you will be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.And finally,bulid a community.No one does big things by themselves.Right now,when people are scared,it's easy to be cynical and say let me just look out for myself,or my family,or people who look or think or pray like me.But if we're going to get through these difficult times;if we're going to create a world where everybody has opportunity to find a job and afford college;if we're going to save the environment and defeat future pandemics,then we're going to have to do it together.
⑦So be alive to be one another's struggles.Stand up for one another's rights.Leave behind all the old ways of thinking that divide us-sexism,racial prejudice,status,greed-and set the world on a different path.When you need help,Michelle and I have made it the mission of our Foundation to give young people like you the skills and support to lead in your own communities,and to connect you with other young leaders around the country and around the globe.But the truth is,you don't need us to tell you what to do because in so many ways you've already started to lead.Congratulations, Class of 2020.Keep making us proud.
①大家好。阿尼耶，谢谢你漂亮的介绍。我对你在奥巴马基金会工作期间所做的一切感到无比自豪。当然，我为2020届毕业班的所有人感到无比自豪，也为指导你们前进的老师、教练和最重要的父母和家人感到骄傲。现在，毕业在任何情况下都是一个巨大的成就。
②然后，就在你即将庆祝成功的时候，就在你期待着毕业舞会、毕业晚会、毕业典礼，以及，让我们面对现实吧，一大堆派对的时候，世界被一场全球性的流行病弄得天翻地覆。尽管我确信你爱你的父母，但我敢打赌，和他们呆在家里玩棋盘游戏或在电视上看《虎王》并不是你想象中的高三最后几个月。现在，我要对你说实话，错过一次现场毕业典礼的失望，很快就会过去。我不太记得自己高中毕业的事了。我知道不必坐在那里听毕业典礼演讲也没那么糟糕。我的通常走得太长。此外，戴这种帽子的人并不多，尤其是如果你像我一样有一双大耳朵的话。一旦直接的公共健康危机结束，你将有足够的时间来赶上你的朋友。
③但仍然正确的是，你的毕业标志着你进入了成年，也就是你开始掌控自己生活的时候。当你决定什么对你来说是重要的，你想追求什么样的职业，你想和谁建立家庭，你想赖以生存的价值观。鉴于目前的世界状况，这可能有点可怕。如果你打算离开去上大学，秋天在校园里辍学，那就不再是既定的了。如果你打算一边上学一边工作，找到第一份工作将会更加困难。甚至相对富裕的家庭也在应对巨大的不确定性。那些以前挣扎过的人，现在危在旦夕。所有这些都意味着你必须比几代人更快地成长。
④这一流行病动摇了现状，暴露了我国许多根深蒂固的问题，从大规模的经济不平等，到持续的种族差异，再到需要的人缺乏基本医疗保健。它唤醒了许多年轻人，让他们意识到旧的做事方式是行不通的；如果你周围的人都又饿又病，你赚多少钱并不重要；我们的社会和我们的民主只有在我们不仅想到自己，而且想到彼此的时候才会起作用。它还拉开了另一个严酷事实的帷幕，一旦我们的童年结束，我们最终都必须接受这个事实。你以前认为的那些成年人是负责人，知道他们在做什么？结果是，他们并不知道所有的答案。很多人甚至没有问对问题。所以，如果世界要变得更好，就要看你自己了。这种认识可能有点吓人，但我希望它也能鼓舞人心。
⑤面对这个国家目前面临的所有挑战，没有人能告诉你，“不，你太年轻了，无法理解”，或者“这是一直以来的做法。”因为有如此多的不确定性，所有东西都突然被抢走，这是你们这一代要塑造的世界。因为我是一个老家伙，我不会告诉你如何使用这种掌握在你手中的权力，但我会给你三条快速的建议。首先，不要害怕。美国经历了奴隶制、内战、饥荒、疾病、大萧条和911之前的艰难时期。每次我们变得更强大，通常是因为像你这样的新一代年轻人，从过去的错误中吸取了教训，并找到了让事情变得更好的方法。其次，做你认为正确的事情。做感觉好、方便、容易的事情，这就是小孩子的想法。不幸的是，许多所谓的成年人，包括一些有着花哨头衔和重要工作的人，仍然这样认为，这就是事情如此糟糕的原因。
⑥相反，我希望你决定将自己建立在持久的价值观上，比如诚实、勤奋、责任、公平、慷慨、尊重他人。你不会每次都做对，你会像我们一样犯错，但是如果你倾听自己内心的真相，即使很难，即使不方便，人们也会注意到。他们会被你吸引。你将成为解决方案的一部分，而不是问题的一部分。最后，建立一个社区。没有人能独自做大事。现在，当人们害怕的时候，很容易变得愤世嫉俗，说让我为自己、我的家人或者像我一样看起来、思考或者祈祷的人着想。但是如果我们要度过这些困难时期。如果我们要创造一个人人都有机会找到工作并负担得起大学费用的世界；如果我们要拯救环境，战胜未来的流行病，那么我们就必须共同努力。
⑦所以，活着就是为了彼此的奋斗。维护彼此的权利。抛弃所有分裂我们的旧思维方式——性别歧视、种族偏见、地位、贪婪——让世界走上不同的道路。当你需要帮助的时候，米歇尔和我已经把给像你这样的年轻人技能和支持作为我们基金会的使命，让他们在自己的社区中发挥领导作用，并把你与全国和全球的其他年轻领导人联系起来。但事实是，你不需要我们告诉你该做什么，因为在很多方面你已经开始领导了。祝贺你们，2020届毕业生。继续让我们骄傲。
