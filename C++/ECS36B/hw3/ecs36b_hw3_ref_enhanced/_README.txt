There are four objects in total:
shadow flight f2 f3 and shadow person p3 p4 are in the client

f2 p3 p4 are real objects in server
f3 directes to another

so hw3server becomes a server and client at the same time

------------------------------------------------------------------
use 'make' to compile the file

then open the hw3server, hw3another, and hw3client in orders

then you will recive which one is running in server and another,
and the real result in client
